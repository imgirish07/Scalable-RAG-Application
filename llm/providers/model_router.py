"""
Model router for the Groq multi-model pool.

Design:
    ModelRouter is the single decision point for "which model should handle
    this call?". It knows two pools (FAST and STRONG), each with a fixed
    priority order. On every call it:

        1. Identifies the call role (FAST vs STRONG) from the max_tokens kwarg.
        2. Iterates the pool in priority order.
        3. Skips models that fail any of the four availability checks
           (cooldown, RPM headroom, TPM headroom, RPD budget, TPD budget).
        4. Returns the first model_id that passes all checks.
        5. Returns None if no model is available in the primary pool.
           GroqModelPool then tries the other pool before giving up.

    Role auto-detection (zero changes to RAG variant code):
        max_tokens ≤ 512  → FAST   (eval, rewrite, classify, completeness checks)
        max_tokens > 512  → STRONG (final synthesis, multi-hop generation)
        max_tokens is None → STRONG (generate() default — large / open-ended)

    Pool definitions:
        FAST   : ["llama-3.1-8b-instant", "openai/gpt-oss-20b", "qwen/qwen3-32b"]
        STRONG : ["moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct", "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
                  "qwen/qwen3-32b", "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"]

        qwen3-32b appears in both pools — its budget is tracked once
        (single ModelRateLimitState keyed by model_id in RateLimitTracker).

    Headroom thresholds:
        Minute windows  : _MIN_RPM_HEADROOM (default 2) and _MIN_TPM_HEADROOM
                          (default 500). These prevent routing a model that has
                          only 1 request left in its minute window — leaving a
                          tiny buffer avoids last-second 429s.
        Daily ceilings  : derived from MODEL_RATE_LIMITS.rpd / tpd minus a
                          small guard margin (_RPD_GUARD, _TPD_GUARD).

    on_429(model_id, retry_after):
        Called by GroqModelPool when a model returns HTTP 429. Delegates to
        RateLimitTracker.on_429() so the model enters cooldown immediately.

Chain of Responsibility:
    GroqModelPool.chat() / .generate() calls ModelRouter.route(role, est_tokens)
    → returns model_id → GroqModelPool dispatches to that model's GroqProvider
    → on success, GroqModelPool calls tracker.update_from_headers() and
    tracker.increment_daily() → on 429, calls ModelRouter.on_429().
