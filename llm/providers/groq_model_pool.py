"""
Multi-model Groq pool — drop-in BaseLLM replacement for single-model GroqProvider.

Design:
    GroqModelPool implements BaseLLM and manages a fixed set of GroqProvider
    instances (one per model). It is a transparent replacement for a plain
    GroqProvider — the RAG pipeline, BaseRAG, and agents all interact with
    BaseLLM and never know they are talking to a pool.

    All generate() / chat() calls are funnelled through a bounded asyncio.Queue.
    A fixed pool of _NUM_WORKERS worker coroutines drain the queue one item at
    a time. This caps in-flight concurrency and prevents the burst-429 race
    condition where multiple callers simultaneously route to the same model
    before any response headers have been received.

    On every dispatched call the pool:

        1. Detects the call role (FAST or STRONG) from the max_tokens kwarg:
               max_tokens ≤ 512  → FAST   (eval, rewrite, classify)
               max_tokens > 512  → STRONG (final synthesis)
               max_tokens is None → STRONG (open-ended generation)

           This is zero-touch for all existing RAG variants — they already pass
           explicit small max_tokens for lightweight calls and omit / use large
           values for generate(). No changes to SimpleRAG are needed.

        2. Asks ModelRouter to pick the best available model.

        3. Dispatches the call to that model's GroqProvider._call_api() using
           the raw openai client so we can access the response headers.

        4. Parses x-ratelimit-* headers from the raw HTTP response and calls
           tracker.update_from_headers() + tracker.increment_daily().

        5. On HTTP 429 (LLMRateLimitError):
               a. Calls router.on_429(model_id, retry_after) to start cooldown.
               b. Immediately re-routes to the next available model and retries.
               c. If ALL models are exhausted, raises LLMRateLimitError to the caller.

        6. On HTTP 404 "model not found" (LLMProviderError):
               Puts the inaccessible model in a 24-hour cooldown so it is
               permanently skipped for the session, then retries with the next
               available model. Does NOT propagate to BaseRAG — the pool stays up.

    Header extraction:
        The OpenAI SDK does not expose raw headers on the parsed response object.
        We use the undocumented `.response` / `._response` attribute on
        AsyncCompletions to capture headers. If that attribute is absent (SDK
        version changes), we degrade gracefully — the tracker simply has no
        new header data and falls back to locally-tracked daily counters.

    Token estimation for routing:
        Before dispatching, we estimate the total tokens for the call using
        tiktoken on the message content. This estimate feeds ModelRouter's TPM
        and TPD headroom checks. It is never exact (Groq counts slightly
        differently) but is accurate enough for capacity planning.

    model_name / provider_name properties:
        Return the *last successfully used* model to give callers a meaningful
        value for logging. On init they return the top-priority STRONG model.

Chain of Responsibility:
    LLMFactory.create_groq_pool() instantiates GroqModelPool →
    returned as BaseLLM to RAGPipeline → BaseRAG calls generate() / chat() →
    GroqModelPool enqueues request → worker pulls from queue → _dispatch() →
    ModelRouter → GroqProvider → parses headers → updates RateLimitTracker.
