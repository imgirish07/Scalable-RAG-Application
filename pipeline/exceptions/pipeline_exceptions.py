"""
Pipeline-layer exceptions.

Design:
    Outermost exception hierarchy in the system. Wraps errors from inner
    layers (RAG, LLM, cache) only when the pipeline needs to communicate
    a pipeline-specific failure. Inner-layer exceptions that are actionable
    by the caller (LLMAuthError, LLMRateLimitError) propagate as-is — the
    pipeline does NOT blanket-wrap everything.

Chain of Responsibility:
    Raised by RAGPipeline; caught by FastAPI exception handlers or callers
    of pipeline.query() / pipeline.ingest().

Dependencies:
    None (stdlib only).
