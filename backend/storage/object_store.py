"""Async S3-compatible object store wrapper.

Single point of contact for MinIO (dev) and AWS S3 (prod, future). All
document blobs flow through this module:

  - `ensure_bucket()`             — boot-time bootstrap (create + CORS)
  - `generate_presigned_put_url()` — issued at upload start; client PUTs to MinIO directly
  - `get_object_stream()`         — streaming download during ingestion finalize
  - `head_object()`               — size + ETag check before download
  - `delete_object()`             — rollback path + orphan sweeper

Credentials are picked up by `aioboto3` from the standard
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars; nothing else in
this module sees them.
