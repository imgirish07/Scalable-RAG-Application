"""
ChunkQualityGate — deterministic quality evaluation for sub-query retrieval results.

Design:
    Evaluates retrieved chunks using average reranker/relevance scores and
    chunk count. Zero LLM calls — purely deterministic signal from the
    cross-encoder already applied by ChunkRetriever.

    Classification:
        strong  — enough chunks with good avg score → pass through as-is.
        weak    — chunks exist but avg score is below threshold → flag for
                  fast-LLM rewrite + one re-retrieval pass.
        failed  — zero chunks → accept as an information gap, synthesizer
                  acknowledges it; no retry attempted.

Chain of Responsibility:
    ChunkRetriever → ChunkQualityGate.evaluate()
    → AgentOrchestrator rewrites weak sub-queries (fast LLM, 1 call each).

Dependencies:
    agents.models.agent_response
