"""
Quality gate that filters out poor LLM responses before caching.

Design:
    Prevents cache poisoning by rejecting responses that are likely
    errors, refusals, or LLM non-answers. Three categories of rejection:
        1. Empty or whitespace-only text
        2. Too few completion tokens (truncated or error responses)
        3. Suspiciously fast latency (instant API errors)
        4. Negative response patterns (polite refusals, context misses)

    Negative patterns block responses like "I don't have enough information"
    from being cached. These are document-specific failures that would
    poison every future cache hit for the matching query until TTL expires.

    Runs on the write path only — zero impact on read latency.
    All checks are sync CPU comparisons on fields already in LLMResponse.

Chain of Responsibility:
    Instantiated by CacheManager. Called by CacheManager.set() before
    any write to L1, L2, or Qdrant. Rejection increments
    CacheMetrics.quality_gate_rejections.

Dependencies:
    llm.models.llm_response (LLMResponse)
