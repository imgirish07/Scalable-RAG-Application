## 1. Vectorstore & Embeddings

---

### OPT-01 · ONNX Runtime for Embedding Inference

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
Replaces PyTorch inference with ONNX Runtime for the embedding model. On GPU, uses
`CUDAExecutionProvider` with `arena_extend_strategy=kNextPowerOfTwo`, HEURISTIC
convolution search, and default CUDA stream pinning to minimise memory fragmentation.
On CPU, ONNX RT's optimised kernels outperform PyTorch eager mode significantly.

**Benefit:**
5–10× faster embedding throughput on CPU. ~2× faster on GPU due to reduced
host-device overhead and optimised convolution paths. Keeps the embedding step from
becoming the bottleneck in end-to-end query latency.

**Drawbacks:**
Requires a separately exported `.onnx` model file. Two export conventions exist
(CUDA-native vs standard) that must be handled at load time. Falls back to PyTorch if
the ONNX file is absent, adding conditional complexity.

**How implemented:**
`ONNXEmbeddings` class wraps `onnxruntime.InferenceSession` with a provider-priority
list `["CUDAExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]`. `_encode()` runs the session
and converts numpy output to `List[List[float]]`.

**Where:** `vectorstore/embeddings.py` — `ONNXEmbeddings` class

---

### OPT-02 · Embedding Model LRU Singleton Cache

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
Decorates `get_embeddings()` and `_get_onnx_embeddings()` with `@lru_cache(maxsize=4)`,
ensuring at most one model instance is loaded per (model_name, device) combination
per process lifetime.

**Benefit:**
Prevents redundant model loading when the embedder is requested from multiple layers
(retriever, context ranker, semantic cache) within the same process. Saves 1–3 seconds
of cold-start model load time per duplicate call.

**Drawbacks:**
Model updates require a process restart. `maxsize=4` is a hard cap — beyond 4 distinct
models, the LRU silently evicts. No way to selectively invalidate a single model.

**How implemented:**
`@lru_cache(maxsize=4)` on `get_embeddings()`. The (model_name, device) tuple forms
the cache key automatically.

**Where:** `vectorstore/embeddings.py` — `get_embeddings()`, `_get_onnx_embeddings()`

---

### OPT-03 · Pre-computed Embedding Dimension Map

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
A static `EMBEDDING_DIMS` dict maps known HuggingFace model IDs to their output
dimensionality (e.g., `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 → 384`), bypassing the need for a
test inference call at Qdrant collection creation time.

**Benefit:**
Eliminates a 1–2 second test embedding call during pipeline cold start. Particularly
important when multiple collections are initialised in sequence.

**Drawbacks:**
Manual maintenance — adding a new model requires a code change to `EMBEDDING_DIMS`.
Unknown models fall back gracefully to a live inference call.

**How implemented:**
Module-level dict lookup in `_get_vector_size()`. Falls back to
`embedder.embed_query("test")` for unknown model IDs.

**Where:** `vectorstore/embeddings.py` — `EMBEDDING_DIMS` constant

---

### OPT-04 · Qdrant Scalar Quantization (INT8)

**Category:** Performance, Scalability

**What it does:**
Collections are configured with `ScalarQuantization(type=INT8, quantile=0.99,
always_ram=True)` and `rescore=True`. Vectors are compressed to INT8 for ANN candidate
search; the full float32 vectors rescore the top candidates.

**Benefit:**
4× VRAM reduction (float32 → int8). 2–3× faster ANN search due to reduced memory
bandwidth. `rescore=True` recovers the ~1% recall loss caused by quantisation.
Enables larger collections to fit in available VRAM.

**Drawbacks:**
~1% recall loss before rescoring (mitigated but not eliminated). Requires
re-quantisation on existing collections when changing the quantile. INT8 range clips
extreme vector values — hence `quantile=0.99` to preserve 99% of the distribution.

**How implemented:**
`ScalarQuantizationConfig` passed to `QdrantClient.create_collection()`.
`SearchParams(quantization=QuantizationSearchParams(rescore=True))` passed on every
search call.

**Where:** `vectorstore/qdrant_store.py` — `_create_collection()`, `search()`,
`hybrid_search_with_vectors()`

---

### OPT-05 · Lazy SPLADE Sparse Model Initialisation

**Category:** Performance, Memory

**What it does:**
The SPLADE sparse embedding model (used only for hybrid retrieval) is loaded on the
first hybrid query, not at pipeline startup. The loaded model is cached on
`self._splade_model` for all subsequent calls.

**Benefit:**
Saves 2–3 seconds of startup time and ~1 GB VRAM for dense-only deployments. SPLADE
is never loaded if hybrid retrieval is not used.

**Drawbacks:**
First hybrid query pays the full model initialisation cost. Adds a conditional branch
to the hot path of hybrid search.

**How implemented:**
`if self._splade_model is None: self._splade_model = SpladeEmbeddings(...)` guard at
the top of `_get_sparse_vector()`.

**Where:** `vectorstore/qdrant_store.py` — `_get_sparse_vector()`

---

### OPT-06 · Embedding Content Enrichment

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
Before embedding, chunk text is enriched to
`"Title: {filename} | Section: {heading}\n{content}"` using document metadata. The
raw content is stored in the Qdrant payload for retrieval; the enriched form is used
only for vector generation.

**Benefit:**
Richer semantic vectors that capture document context (source + section) in addition
to content. Improves retrieval precision for queries that implicitly reference a
document or section. Estimated 5–15% improvement in top-5 recall.

**Drawbacks:**
Slightly increases embedding latency (longer input string). Requires `source` and
`section_heading` metadata fields to be populated by the chunking pipeline upstream.

**How implemented:**
`embed_content = f"Title: {source} | Section: {heading}\n{content}"` computed in
`add_documents()` before calling `embedder.embed_documents()`.

**Where:** `vectorstore/qdrant_store.py` — `add_documents()`

---

### OPT-07 · SPLADE Batch Size Tuning for GPU Budget

**Category:** Performance, Reliability

**What it does:**
`SPLADE_BATCH_SIZE` (default 16) is exposed as a configurable setting. At batch
size 16, SPLADE consumes ~1.0 GB VRAM — within the budget of a 4 GB GPU. Larger
batches trigger OOM and silent CPU fallback.

**Benefit:**
Keeps SPLADE inference on GPU (2–4 s per batch vs 53+ s on CPU). Prevents OOM
crashes that otherwise fall back to CPU silently with no error logged.

**Drawbacks:**
Batch size must be tuned per GPU model. On GPUs with less than 4 GB VRAM, reduce
to 8 or lower. Increasing batch size does not proportionally improve throughput
beyond a point.

**How implemented:**
`SPLADE_BATCH_SIZE` read from `settings` in `_encode_sparse_batch()`. The batch loop
processes `texts[i : i + batch_size]`.

**Where:** `config/settings.py` — `SPLADE_BATCH_SIZE`;
`vectorstore/qdrant_store.py` — `_encode_sparse_batch()`

---

### OPT-08 · gRPC Transport for Qdrant

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
Connects to Qdrant via gRPC (`prefer_grpc=True`) instead of HTTP/REST. gRPC uses
binary Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2, reducing per-request serialisation overhead and
enabling connection multiplexing.

**Benefit:**
10–30% lower per-request latency. HTTP/2 multiplexing allows concurrent requests on
a single connection, reducing overhead under parallel sub-query load.

**Drawbacks:**
Requires a gRPC-compatible Qdrant server version. Network proxies and some
firewalls block gRPC. Set `QDRANT_PREFER_GRPC=false` in restricted environments.

**How implemented:**
`prefer_grpc=settings.QDRANT_PREFER_GRPC` passed to `QdrantClient()` constructor.

**Where:** `vectorstore/qdrant_store.py` — `__init__()`;
`config/settings.py` — `QDRANT_PREFER_GRPC`

---

## 2. Reranker

---

### OPT-09 · CUDA-Native ONNX Export for Reranker

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
At load time, selects the CUDA-native ONNX export of the cross-encoder (no Memcpy
nodes) when a GPU is present. Falls back to the standard export when GPU is
unavailable or the CUDA export is missing. The CUDA-native export eliminates
host-device memory transfers between ops.

**Benefit:**
~3× faster GPU reranking by removing redundant host-to-device Memcpy nodes in the
standard ONNX export. Critical for keeping reranker latency under 100 ms for
batches of 8–10 pairs.

**Drawbacks:**
Requires a separate ONNX export build step with CUDA-specific flags. Two model paths
must be maintained. If the CUDA export is absent, performance silently degrades to
standard export speed with no warning.

**How implemented:**
`_load_onnx()` checks for `{model_dir}/cuda/model.onnx` when
`torch.cuda.is_available()`, falls back to `{model_dir}/model.onnx`. Provider list
is `["CUDAExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]`.

**Where:** `vectorstore/reranker.py` — `_load_onnx()`

---

### OPT-10 · Reranker Pre-filtering (COARSE_TOP_K)

**Category:** Performance, Cost

**What it does:**
Before cross-encoder inference, retains only the top `RERANKER_PREFILTER_TOP_N`
(default 8) chunks ranked by bi-encoder score. Bottom-ranked candidates are dropped
before the expensive joint (query + chunk) inference.

**Benefit:**
Reduces cross-encoder inference by up to 20% on typical queries (where retrieval
fetches 10–12 candidates). Cross-encoder rarely rescues chunks ranked below position
8 by the bi-encoder.

**Drawbacks:**
Chunks ranked 9+ by the bi-encoder never reach the cross-encoder, even if they
contain relevant information the bi-encoder missed.

**How implemented:**
`candidates = candidates[:self.prefilter_top_n]` slice before `_score_pairs()` in
`rerank()`.

**Where:** `vectorstore/reranker.py` — `rerank()`

---

### OPT-11 · Relative Score Threshold Filtering

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
After cross-encoder scoring, retains only chunks where
`score >= max(top_score × RERANKER_SCORE_RATIO, RERANKER_MIN_SCORE)`. The ratio
(default 0.3) is relative to the top chunk's score, making the threshold adaptive to
query difficulty. The top-1 chunk is always retained.

**Benefit:**
Prevents low-quality chunks from entering the context window even if their absolute
score passes a fixed threshold. Adapts automatically — a low-confidence query (max
0.3) sets a lower absolute threshold than a high-confidence query (max 0.9).

**Drawbacks:**
Hard-coded default ratio (0.3) and minimum (0.1) may not suit all domains.
Domain-specific tuning is required. If the ratio is too aggressive, borderline-
relevant chunks are dropped (in one observed case the margin was only 0.009).

**How implemented:**
`threshold = max(top_score * self.score_ratio, self.min_score)` → filter
`[c for c in scored if c.score >= threshold]` with a `[:1]` fallback guarantee.

**Where:** `vectorstore/reranker.py` — `rerank()`

---

### OPT-12 · Batched Cross-Encoder Inference

**Category:** Performance, Reliability

**What it does:**
Processes `(query, chunk)` pairs through the cross-encoder in batches of
`RERANKER_BATCH_SIZE` (default 8 for ONNX, 4 for PyTorch) rather than one at a
time.

**Benefit:**
Prevents VRAM OOM when reranking large candidate sets (10–20 pairs). Batching fully
utilises GPU SIMD throughput — single-pair inference wastes ~90% of GPU capacity.

**Drawbacks:**
Batch size must be tuned per GPU. Larger batches improve throughput but increase
per-batch latency for small candidate sets.

**How implemented:**
`_score_pairs_onnx()` and `_score_pairs_pytorch()` loop over
`range(0, len(pairs), batch_size)`, process each slice, concatenate results.

**Where:** `vectorstore/reranker.py` — `_score_pairs_onnx()`, `_score_pairs_pytorch()`

---

## 3. RAG Pipeline

---

### OPT-13 · Sealed Template-Method Pipeline

**Category:** Reliability, Maintainability

**What it does:**
`BaseRAG.query()` is a sealed orchestrator. Subclasses override only the hook
methods (`retrieve`, `rank`, `assemble_context`, `generate`) in a fixed order. Cache
check/write, timing instrumentation, and confidence computation are always handled by
the base class.

**Benefit:**
Guarantees all RAG variants share identical cache behaviour, timing, and logging.
No variant can accidentally skip the cache or produce an inconsistent response shape.
New cross-cutting concerns (e.g., tracing) are added in one place.

**Drawbacks:**
Less flexibility for highly custom RAG flows that need to interleave steps
differently. Variants needing fundamentally different orchestration must work around
the fixed order.

**How implemented:**
Template Method pattern: `query()` calls `self.retrieve()`, `self.rank()`, etc.
Subclasses override only the hook methods.

**Where:** `rag/base_rag.py` — `query()`

---

### OPT-14 · Cross-Encoder Fetch Multiplier (COARSE_TOP_K)

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
When cross-encoder reranking is active, the retrieval step fetches
`RERANKER_COARSE_TOP_K` candidates (default 8–10) instead of `config.top_k`
(default 5). The reranker then selects the best `top_k` from the larger pool.

**Benefit:**
Gives the cross-encoder a richer set of candidates to select from, improving final
precision. Without the multiplier, the bi-encoder may miss the best chunk if it is
not in the top-5. Estimated 10–20% precision@5 improvement.

**Drawbacks:**
Doubles retrieval cost for typical configurations (5 → 10 candidates). Extra
candidates that do not survive reranking are retrieved and ranked at wasted cost.

**How implemented:**
`fetch_k = settings.RERANKER_COARSE_TOP_K if use_reranker else config.top_k`
computed in `BaseRAG.retrieve()`.

**Where:** `rag/base_rag.py` — `retrieve()`

---

### OPT-15 · Reranker Threshold Guard (Hallucination Prevention)

**Category:** Quality, Reliability

**What it does:**
After reranking, if all remaining chunks score below `RERANKER_SCORE_THRESHOLD` or
no chunks survive the relative filter, the pipeline returns a transparent
"insufficient context" response instead of passing irrelevant content to the LLM.

**Benefit:**
Prevents the LLM from hallucinating answers from irrelevant context. Gives the user
an explicit, honest signal rather than a confident wrong answer.

**Drawbacks:**
Requires threshold tuning per domain. Too aggressive a threshold rejects borderline-
relevant results; too lenient allows hallucination.

**How implemented:**
Post-rerank check: `if not ranked_chunks: return self._no_context_response(request)`
before `assemble_context()`.

**Where:** `rag/base_rag.py` — `query()`

---

### OPT-16 · In-Flight Request Coalescing

**Category:** Performance, Scalability

**What it does:**
When an identical query is already being processed, subsequent requests for the same
query wait on an `asyncio.Event` rather than launching independent RAG pipelines.
When the first request completes, all waiters receive the same result. The event is
released even on early exits (e.g., reranker threshold not met).

**Benefit:**
Eliminates N−1 redundant RAG executions under concurrent identical queries (thundering
herd). Reduces LLM API cost proportionally to concurrency factor for popular queries.

**Drawbacks:**
All waiters are blocked for the full duration of the first request. Error propagation
to waiters requires careful exception handling. Cache must be populated before the
event is released.

**How implemented:**
`CacheManager.get_or_wait()` / `resolve_in_flight()` tracks in-flight keys via an
`asyncio.Event` dict. Called in `BaseRAG.query()` at the start and end of execution.

**Where:** `cache/cache_manager.py` — `get_or_wait()`, `resolve_in_flight()`;
`rag/base_rag.py` — `query()`

---

## 4. Context Ranking & Assembly

---

### OPT-17 · MMR Using Pre-fetched Qdrant Vectors (Zero Re-embedding)

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) requires inter-chunk similarity computation. Instead
of re-embedding all chunks, the ranker uses the raw embedding vectors already returned
by Qdrant's `with_vectors=True` search response. Falls back to re-embedding only if
vectors are absent.

**Benefit:**
Eliminates a re-embedding pass that would cost 3–10 seconds for a batch of chunks.
MMR ranking becomes effectively free — a few matrix multiplications on pre-fetched
float arrays.

**Drawbacks:**
Requires the retriever to request `with_vectors=True` from Qdrant, adding ~5–10%
to retrieval payload size. The slow fallback path exists but is rarely triggered.

**How implemented:**
`ContextRanker._rank_mmr()` checks `doc.metadata.get("vector")` first. If present,
uses it directly for cosine similarity. If absent, calls `embeddings_fn()`.

**Where:** `rag/context/context_ranker.py` — `_rank_mmr()`

---

### OPT-18 · Cross-Encoder Confidence Scoring

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
When `strategy=cross_encoder`, `ContextRanker` delegates to `CrossEncoderReranker`
and propagates per-chunk relevance scores as confidence metadata. The response
`ConfidenceScore.method` field is set to `"reranker"` to distinguish these scores
from bi-encoder cosine similarity values.

**Benefit:**
Cross-encoder joint (query + chunk) scoring is significantly more accurate than
bi-encoder cosine similarity for precision tasks. Scores are propagated to the
response for downstream confidence decisions.

**Drawbacks:**
50–200 ms additional latency per query depending on GPU availability and batch size.
Unnecessary overhead for simple factual queries where bi-encoder precision is
already sufficient.

**How implemented:**
`ContextRanker.rank()` branches on `self.strategy == "cross_encoder"` → calls
`self.reranker.rerank()`. Returns re-sorted docs with `reranker_score` in metadata.

**Where:** `rag/context/context_ranker.py` — `rank()`, `_rank_cross_encoder()`

---

### OPT-19 · Whole-Chunk Assembly (No Mid-Chunk Truncation)

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
The context assembler uses a greedy token-budget loop. Each chunk's token count is
checked in full — if adding the chunk would exceed `max_tokens`, the chunk is
**skipped**, never truncated. The LLM always receives semantically complete units.

**Benefit:**
Truncating a chunk mid-sentence degrades LLM comprehension significantly. Whole-chunk
assembly guarantees complete semantic units in every prompt.

**Drawbacks:**
If the highest-ranked chunk is very long (> token budget), it may be excluded entirely
even though it is the most relevant. The budget may never be fully utilised if no
remaining chunk fits the remaining space.

**How implemented:**
`for chunk in ranked_chunks: tokens = count_tokens(chunk); if used + tokens > budget:
continue; context.append(chunk); used += tokens`

**Where:** `rag/context/context_assembler.py` — `assemble()`

---

### OPT-20 · Token Budget Enforcement Before LLM Call

**Category:** Reliability, Cost

**What it does:**
Before assembly, the assembler counts tokens for each candidate chunk using
`BaseLLM.count_tokens()`. Assembly proceeds only if the full context fits within
`max_context_tokens`. Prevents prompt truncation errors at the LLM API.

**Benefit:**
Ensures the model receives the full context it was given. Prevents silent truncation
at the API boundary, which would cause the LLM to answer from partial context
without any error.

**Drawbacks:**
`count_tokens()` may be async (Gemini) or involve tiktoken inference, adding
measurable latency per chunk when no batching is supported by the provider.

**How implemented:**
`await llm.count_tokens(text)` or `llm.count_tokens(text)` called per chunk in
`assemble()`. Running total tracked in `used_tokens`.

**Where:** `rag/context/context_assembler.py` — `assemble()`

---

## 5. RAG Variants

---

### OPT-21 · SimpleRAG as Low-Latency Default

**Category:** Performance, Cost

**What it does:**
`SimpleRAG` is the default variant for all queries. It executes a single
retrieve → rank → assemble → generate pass with no evaluation, retries, or multi-hop
steps.

**Benefit:**
Lowest possible latency (200–500 ms end-to-end). Zero extra LLM calls. Correctly
handles 80%+ of real-world queries.

**Drawbacks:**
No safeguard against poor retrieval. If the bi-encoder retrieves irrelevant chunks,
the LLM may hallucinate without any corrective mechanism.

**How implemented:**
`SimpleRAG` overrides only `retrieve()` and `generate()` with direct single-pass
implementations. All orchestration is inherited from `BaseRAG`.

**Where:** `rag/variants/simple_rag.py`;
`config/settings.py` — `RAG_DEFAULT_VARIANT=simple`

---

### OPT-22 · CorrectiveRAG Selective Evaluation

**Category:** Quality, Reliability

**What it does:**
After retrieval, evaluates only the top `eval_chunk_count` (default 3) chunks using
an LLM relevance evaluator. If average score < `pass_threshold` (0.7), rewrites the
query and re-retrieves once. If < `retry_threshold` (0.4), flags the response as
low-confidence.

**Benefit:**
Catches hallucination before generation. Provides a second retrieval attempt for
ambiguous queries. Evaluating only top-3 keeps cost constant at O(1) regardless of
total retrieval size.

**Drawbacks:**
Adds `eval_chunk_count` evaluation LLM calls per query. Only one retry is permitted
— a second poor retrieval still produces a low-quality answer.

**How implemented:**
`_evaluate_chunks()` scores top-3. `_retry_with_rewrite()` calls `_rewrite_query()`
then re-retrieves if score < threshold.

**Where:** `rag/variants/corrective_rag.py`

---

### OPT-23 · ChainRAG Multi-Hop Iterative Retrieval

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
Generates a draft answer, evaluates whether it is complete, issues a targeted
follow-up query to retrieve missing information, and repeats up to `max_hops`
(default 3) times. Each hop adds new chunks to a cumulative context window.

**Benefit:**
Resolves multi-document dependencies where no single chunk answers the full question
(e.g., policy → referenced regulation → appendix). Builds a complete answer
iteratively.

**Drawbacks:**
2–4 additional LLM calls per complex query (draft generation + completeness evaluation
per hop). Latency scales linearly with hops.

**How implemented:**
`retrieve()` loop: generate draft → `_evaluate_completeness()` → if incomplete,
`_build_follow_up_query()` → retrieve more → merge context → repeat.

**Where:** `rag/variants/chain_rag.py`

---

### OPT-24 · ChainRAG Follow-Up Query Length Guard

**Category:** Reliability, Cost

**What it does:**
Rejects follow-up queries that exceed 5× the length of the original query. Catches
cases where the LLM generates a malformed or runaway follow-up that would produce
meaningless retrieval results and waste LLM budget.

**Benefit:**
Hard upper bound on per-hop cost. Prevents infinite-loop scenarios from a confused
LLM generating increasingly long queries.

**Drawbacks:**
Hard-coded 5× ratio may reject legitimate verbose follow-ups for very short original
queries.

**How implemented:**
`if len(follow_up) > len(original) * 5: break` guard in the hop loop.

**Where:** `rag/variants/chain_rag.py` — `retrieve()`

---

## 6. Cache — Architecture

---

### OPT-25 · Multi-Layer Cache Hierarchy (L1 + L2 + Semantic)

**Category:** Performance, Scalability, Cost

**What it does:**
Implements a three-tier lookup: L1 in-memory LRU (< 1 ms), L2 Redis with connection
pooling (< 5 ms), semantic Qdrant similarity search (10–30 ms). Each layer is checked
in order; misses fall through to the next.

**Benefit:**
Sub-millisecond hits for hot queries. Redis provides persistence across restarts.
Semantic cache captures paraphrase queries. Combined, hit rates of 60–80% are
achievable in production, eliminating the majority of LLM API cost.

**Drawbacks:**
Each layer adds operational surface area. L1 is per-instance and not shared across
horizontally-scaled processes. Semantic cache adds ~10–30 ms overhead on every miss.

**How implemented:**
`CacheManager.check()` tries `exact_strategy.lookup()` → L1 miss → L2 lookup →
L2 miss → `semantic_strategy.lookup()` → full RAG on miss.

**Where:** `cache/cache_manager.py` — `check()`, `write()`

---

### OPT-26 · L2-to-L1 Promotion at Pipeline Startup

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
At startup, `CacheManager` scans Redis for up to 100 recent entries, deserialises
them, and writes them to the L1 memory cache with their remaining TTLs.

**Benefit:**
Eliminates the cold-cache period after a process restart. First requests after restart
hit L1 instead of Redis or LLM. Critical for rolling deployments.

**Drawbacks:**
Deserialising up to 100 Redis entries adds ~100–500 ms to startup. Limited to 100
entries — large caches remain cold beyond that cap.

**How implemented:**
`CacheManager._warm_l1_from_l2()` called in `__init__()`. Scans Redis keys,
deserialises `CacheEntry`, writes to `MemoryBackend` with remaining TTL.

**Where:** `cache/cache_manager.py` — `_warm_l1_from_l2()`

---

### OPT-27 · Semantic Cache Seeding from Redis at Startup

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
Alongside L1 promotion, seeds the semantic Qdrant index with query embeddings from
Redis entries. Paraphrase lookups work immediately after restart without waiting for
organic traffic to rebuild the index.

**Benefit:**
Semantic cache is warm on restart. Paraphrase hits are available from the first user
query, not only after the cache is organically rebuilt over time.

**Drawbacks:**
Requires embedding each cached query at startup — one embed call per Redis entry,
adding latency proportional to Redis cache size.

**How implemented:**
`CacheManager._seed_semantic_cache()` iterates L2 entries and calls
`semantic_strategy.store()` for each.

**Where:** `cache/cache_manager.py` — `_seed_semantic_cache()`

---

## 7. Cache — Backends

---

### OPT-28 · Redis Circuit Breaker

**Category:** Reliability

**What it does:**
Wraps all Redis backend calls with a circuit breaker. After `failure_threshold`
(default 5) consecutive failures, the breaker trips to OPEN for `cooldown_seconds`
(default 60). After cooldown, transitions to HALF_OPEN for a single probe request.
On probe success, returns to CLOSED.

**Benefit:**
Prevents cascade failures where dead Redis causes every query to hang for the full
Redis timeout (2 s per call). Cache degradation is graceful — the system continues
serving requests from L1 and full LLM fallback.

**Drawbacks:**
All Redis cache hits are lost for the 60-second open period. A hard-coded failure
threshold (5) may trip on transient network blips.

**How implemented:**
`CircuitBreaker.allow_request()` checked before every Redis operation. State machine:
CLOSED → OPEN (on failure_threshold) → HALF_OPEN (after cooldown) → CLOSED (on probe
success).

**Where:** `cache/backend/circuit_breaker.py`;
`cache/backend/redis_backend.py`

---

### OPT-29 · L1 LRU Eviction with O(1) Complexity

**Category:** Performance, Memory

**What it does:**
The L1 memory backend uses Python's `OrderedDict` to implement LRU eviction. On get,
the accessed entry is moved to the end. On set, if `len > max_size`, the first
(oldest) entry is evicted. All operations are O(1).

**Benefit:**
Bounded, predictable memory usage (default 1000 entries). O(1) eviction means no GC
pressure from sorting. Keeps hot queries in cache regardless of insertion order.

**Drawbacks:**
Fixed entry count limit (1000) regardless of entry size. No byte-based eviction
policy — 1000 large responses uses more RAM than 1000 small ones.

**How implemented:**
`OrderedDict` as the backing store. `_evict_if_needed()` pops
`next(iter(self._cache))`. `get()` calls `self._cache.move_to_end(key)`.

**Where:** `cache/backend/memory_backend.py` — `MemoryBackend`

---

### OPT-30 · L1 Lazy TTL Expiry (No Background Sweeper)

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
Expired L1 entries are deleted on access rather than by a background sweeper thread.
`get()` checks `time.monotonic() > entry.expires_at` and returns `None` (deleting
the entry) if expired.

**Benefit:**
Zero background thread overhead. No GC pressure from periodic scans. Simple,
correct implementation that avoids thread-safety complexity.

**Drawbacks:**
Stale entries remain in memory until accessed. Memory is not freed until the query is
re-issued. Under low-traffic conditions, expired entries may accumulate.

**How implemented:**
`if time.monotonic() > slot.expires_at: del self._cache[key]; return None` in
`MemoryBackend.get()`.

**Where:** `cache/backend/memory_backend.py` — `get()`

---

### OPT-31 · Async Redis Connection Pooling

**Category:** Performance, Scalability

**What it does:**
Uses `redis.asyncio.ConnectionPool` with `max_connections=20` and a per-operation
socket timeout of 2.0 s. The pool is created once and shared across all Redis
backend calls in the process.

**Benefit:**
Reuses TCP connections, eliminating per-request connection setup latency (3-way
handshake + TLS = 5–50 ms per request). The pool of 20 handles concurrent requests
without exhaustion.

**Drawbacks:**
Pool of 20 connections may contend under extreme concurrency (> 20 simultaneous cache
operations). Connection pool is per-process and not shared across instances.

**How implemented:**
`redis.asyncio.ConnectionPool.from_url()` created in `RedisBackend._ensure_initialized()`.
Shared `redis.asyncio.Redis(connection_pool=pool)` client used for all operations.

**Where:** `cache/backend/redis_backend.py` — `_ensure_initialized()`

---

## 8. Cache — Query Normalization

---

### OPT-32 · Query Normalizer Chain

**Category:** Quality (Cache Hit Rate)

**What it does:**
Applies a sequential chain of normalizers to every query before cache key generation:
(1) Unicode NFC normalization, (2) lowercase, (3) whitespace collapse, (4) punctuation
stripping, (5) optional stopword removal. Each normalizer is a stateless callable
implementing `BaseNormalizer`.

**Benefit:**
Maps query variants like `"What is RAG?"`, `"what is rag"`, and `"What is RAG "` to
the same cache key, increasing effective hit rate without requiring semantic similarity
overhead.

**Drawbacks:**
Aggressive normalisation may equate semantically different queries (e.g.,
`"Python vs not-Python"` stripped of stopwords can collapse incorrectly). Cannot be
applied selectively per-query.

**How implemented:**
`QueryNormalizer.normalize()` iterates `self._chain: List[BaseNormalizer]` and applies
each in sequence.

**Where:** `cache/normalizers/query_normalizer.py` — `QueryNormalizer`

---

### OPT-33 · SHA-256 Cache Fingerprint

**Category:** Performance, Quality

**What it does:**
Generates a deterministic SHA-256 hex digest from the concatenation of
`normalized_query + "|" + model_name + "|" + str(temperature)`. Used as the
exact-match cache key.

**Benefit:**
O(1) fixed-length key regardless of query length. Includes model and temperature to
prevent cross-model cache collisions (same query, different model = different result).

**Drawbacks:**
One-way hash — cannot recover the original query from the key for debugging without
storing it separately in the cache entry.

**How implemented:**
`hashlib.sha256(fingerprint.encode()).hexdigest()` in
`QueryNormalizer.build_cache_fingerprint()`.

**Where:** `cache/normalizers/query_normalizer.py` — `build_cache_fingerprint()`

---

## 9. Cache — Quality & TTL

---

### OPT-34 · Quality Gate Before Cache Write

**Category:** Quality, Reliability

**What it does:**
Before writing a RAG response to cache, `QualityGate.check()` validates four
conditions: (1) confidence score >= threshold, (2) answer length >= 20 tokens,
(3) answer does not contain negative-answer phrases ("I don't have", "cannot find",
etc.), (4) generation latency >= 100 ms (filters accidental error responses).

**Benefit:**
Prevents cache poisoning with low-quality, error, or non-answer responses. A cached
"I don't have information" would serve all future identical queries with a bad answer.

**Drawbacks:**
Negative pattern list requires manual curation and domain-specific tuning. The 100 ms
latency minimum may reject legitimate fast responses from highly optimised providers.

**How implemented:**
`QualityGate.check(response) -> bool` called in `CacheManager.write()` before any
backend write operation.

**Where:** `cache/quality/quality_gate.py` — `check()`;
`cache/cache_manager.py` — `write()`

---

### OPT-35 · TTL Classification by Query Type

**Category:** Quality, Cost

**What it does:**
Classifies each query into a TTL tier using regex pattern matching: FACTUAL (1 hr),
CONCEPTUAL (24 hr), CODE (12 hr), SUMMARIZATION (7 days), TRANSLATION (7 days),
CREATIVE (3 days). Falls back to DEFAULT_TTL (6 hr) if no pattern matches.

**Benefit:**
Stable knowledge (translations, code patterns) is cached for days, maximising cost
savings. Volatile facts expire hourly, preventing stale responses. Adaptive TTL
balances freshness versus hit rate across different query types.

**Drawbacks:**
Regex classification may misidentify query types. Misclassifying a factual query as
conceptual (24 hr instead of 1 hr) may serve stale answers. Tuning requires domain
knowledge.

**How implemented:**
`TTLClassifier.classify(query) -> int` applies regex patterns in priority order,
returns TTL in seconds.

**Where:** `cache/quality/ttl_classifier.py` — `TTLClassifier.classify()`

---

## 10. Cache — Lookup Strategies

---

### OPT-36 · Exact Match Strategy (SHA-256 Key Lookup)

**Category:** Performance

**What it does:**
First-tier lookup: computes the SHA-256 fingerprint of the normalised query and
performs a direct key lookup in L1 (dict `__contains__`) and L2 (Redis `GET`). No
embedding or similarity computation required.

**Benefit:**
Sub-millisecond lookup cost. Zero false positives — either an exact match or no match.
Handles repeated identical queries (the dominant pattern in production) at negligible
cost.

**Drawbacks:**
Misses all paraphrase queries ("What is RAG?" vs "Explain RAG"). Covered by the
semantic strategy as a fallback.

**How implemented:**
`ExactCacheStrategy.lookup(fingerprint) -> Optional[CacheResult]` checks L1 first,
then L2.

**Where:** `cache/strategies/exact_strategy.py`

---

### OPT-37 · Semantic Cache with BGE Embeddings + In-Memory Qdrant

**Category:** Quality, Cost

**What it does:**
Second-tier lookup: embeds the query using the shared BGE model, searches an in-process
Qdrant collection for the nearest cached query vector. Uses tiered cosine similarity
thresholds: `direct_hit >= 0.98`, `high_confidence >= 0.93`.

**Benefit:**
Catches paraphrase queries that exact matching misses — "What is RAG?" and "Explain
Retrieval-Augmented Generation" will match if cosine similarity >= 0.93. Each semantic
hit saves one full LLM inference call.

**Drawbacks:**
Adds ~10–30 ms per miss (embed + Qdrant search). The in-memory Qdrant is per-process
and not shared across instances. Conservative thresholds (0.93+) may miss some valid
paraphrases.

**How implemented:**
`SemanticCacheStrategy.find_similar(query_vector) -> Optional[SimilarityMatch]`.
Qdrant `search()` with `score_threshold=self.min_threshold`. Tier assigned based on
returned score.

**Where:** `cache/strategies/semantic_strategy.py`

---

### OPT-38 · Isolated In-Memory Qdrant for Semantic Cache

**Category:** Reliability, Performance

**What it does:**
The semantic cache always instantiates its own private in-memory `QdrantClient()`,
separate from the production RAG Qdrant instance. It stores only
`(query_embedding → cache_key)` mappings, not document chunks.

**Benefit:**
Eliminates 200 ms+ cloud RTT on every semantic cache lookup. Prevents
cross-contamination between the cache query index and the document corpus.
Memory footprint is small — one 384-dim vector per cached query.

**Drawbacks:**
Per-process only — not shared across horizontally-scaled instances. Index is rebuilt
on restart (mitigated by startup seeding from Redis, see OPT-27).

**How implemented:**
`SemanticCacheStrategy.__init__()` creates `QdrantClient(":memory:")` and a dedicated
collection.

**Where:** `cache/strategies/semantic_strategy.py` — `_create_client()`

---

## 11. LLM — Rate Limiting

---

### OPT-39 · Token Bucket Rate Limiter (Async-Safe)

**Category:** Reliability, Cost

**What it does:**
Implements a token bucket with two independent buckets per provider: RPM (refill
rate = rpm/60 tokens/sec) and RPD (refill rate = rpd/86400 tokens/sec). Each
`acquire()` consumes one token from both buckets, sleeping the precise time needed if
either is empty. Uses `asyncio.Lock` for coroutine safety.

**Benefit:**
Prevents 429 (Too Many Requests) errors from LLM providers. Precise sleep
calculation avoids over-waiting — a fixed `sleep(60/rpm)` would waste up to 59 s per
slot. Async-safe: multiple coroutines share the same bucket without race conditions.

**Drawbacks:**
Lock contention under extreme concurrency. Requires per-model RPM/RPD configuration.
RPD bucket has a very slow refill rate — even a brief burst near the daily limit can
cause long waits.

**How implemented:**
`TokenBucket.acquire()` calls `_refill()` then checks available tokens. If
insufficient, computes `sleep_time = (needed - available) / refill_rate` and calls
`asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)`.

**Where:** `llm/rate_limiter/token_bucket.py`

---

### OPT-40 · Three-Layer Rate Limiting Architecture

**Category:** Reliability, Scalability

**What it does:**
Every LLM call passes through three sequential gates: (1) `asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)`
— cap on simultaneous in-flight requests, (2) RPM token bucket — per-minute rate
limit, (3) RPD token bucket — per-day quota.

**Benefit:**
Prevents thundering herd (semaphore), per-minute burst (RPM), and per-day cost
overrun (RPD). Layered design means each concern is handled independently and
composably.

**Drawbacks:**
Three sequential acquisitions add ~0–2 ms overhead when tokens are available.
`count_tokens()` intentionally bypasses rate limiting — token count calls can pile up
under load.

**How implemented:**
`LLMRateLimiter.generate()` and `chat()` acquire semaphore → RPM bucket → RPD bucket
in sequence before delegating to the wrapped `BaseLLM`.

**Where:** `llm/rate_limiter/llm_rate_limiter.py`

---

### OPT-41 · Per-Model Rate Limit Registry

**Category:** Reliability, Cost

**What it does:**
A static registry maps every known Gemini, Groq, and OpenAI model to its RPM and RPD
limits. Unknown models fall back to conservative defaults (`_UNKNOWN_MODEL_RPM`,
`_UNKNOWN_MODEL_RPD`).

**Benefit:**
Accurate rate limiting per model tier — Gemini Flash (1500 RPM free) is not throttled
the same as Gemini Pro (60 RPM free). Prevents 429 errors in production without
manual threshold tuning.

**Drawbacks:**
Registry must be updated manually when providers change their rate limits. Unknown
models fall back to a potentially too-conservative default, unnecessarily throttling
new models.

**How implemented:**
`ModelLimits.get_limits(model_name) -> _ModelLimits` looks up the `_LIMITS` dict,
falls back to `_UNKNOWN_MODEL_RPM / _UNKNOWN_MODEL_RPD`.

**Where:** `llm/rate_limiter/model_limits.py`

---

## 12. LLM — Reliability & Factory

---

### OPT-42 · Provider Health Tracker with Auto-Cooldown

**Category:** Reliability

**What it does:**
A singleton `ProviderHealthTracker` records provider failures with a timestamp.
A provider is considered healthy if it has not failed within `_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`
(default 60). `LLMFactory.create()` skips unhealthy providers and routes to the
next healthy one in the priority list.

**Benefit:**
Automatic failover without manual intervention. Dead providers are skipped for 60 s,
preventing repeated timeout waits. Auto-recovery after cooldown — no ops action
required.

**Drawbacks:**
Hard-coded 60 s cooldown does not distinguish failure types — an auth error (permanent)
is treated the same as a network blip (transient). A provider that fails once every
61 s will always appear healthy but keep failing.

**How implemented:**
`ProviderHealthTracker.mark_failed(provider)` stores `{provider: timestamp}`.
`is_healthy(provider)` checks `time.time() - ts > _COOLDOWN_SECONDS`. Singleton via
module-level `_tracker` instance.

**Where:** `llm/provider_health.py`

---

### OPT-43 · LLMFactory Provider Registry

**Category:** Scalability, Maintainability

**What it does:**
`LLMFactory` uses a class-level `_registry` dict mapping provider name strings
(`"gemini"`, `"groq"`, `"openai"`) to their `BaseLLM` subclasses. Adding a new
provider requires only a single registry entry.

**Benefit:**
Zero boilerplate for new providers — no if/elif chains to maintain. Enables runtime
provider registration for plugins or tests. All factory methods (`create`,
`create_rate_limited`, `create_from_settings`) use the same registry.

**Drawbacks:**
Runtime registration can cause import-order bugs if a provider is registered before
its dependencies are installed.

**How implemented:**
`_registry: dict[str, type[BaseLLM]] = {"gemini": GeminiProvider, ...}`. `create()`
looks up `_registry[provider_name]` and instantiates with config.

**Where:** `llm/llm_factory.py`

---

### OPT-44 · Groq Fast-Fail Timeout

**Category:** Reliability

**What it does:**
Sets Groq provider timeout to 5.0 s (vs the default 30 s). In environments where a
a network proxy blocks Groq, the 5 s timeout triggers the health-tracker failover
quickly rather than hanging for 30 s.

**Benefit:**
Reduces user-visible latency on provider failure from 30 s to 5 s. Combined with the
health tracker, the failed provider is sidelined for 60 s after the first failure.

**Drawbacks:**
5 s may time out legitimate slow Groq responses on long context generation.

**How implemented:**
`GROQ_TIMEOUT=5.0` in `config/settings.py`. Passed as `timeout=settings.GROQ_TIMEOUT`
in `GroqProvider.__init__()`.

**Where:** `config/settings.py` — `GROQ_TIMEOUT`;
`llm/providers/groq_provider.py` — `__init__()`

---

### OPT-55 · Groq Queue + Worker Burst Protection

**Category:** Reliability, Scalability

**What it does:**
`GroqModelPool` fronts all Groq calls with an `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=50)` drained by
3 persistent worker coroutines. Every `chat()` / `generate()` call enqueues a
`_RequestItem(messages, kwargs, future)` and awaits its `asyncio.Future`. Workers pick
items off the queue one at a time and resolve the future with the result or exception.
If the queue is full (50 items backlogged), the call is rejected immediately with
`LLMRateLimitError` rather than blocking the event loop.

**Benefit:**
Caps simultaneous in-flight Groq requests at 3 regardless of how many coroutines call
the pool concurrently. Eliminates burst 429s that occur when stale `remaining_rpm`
headers are in flight and multiple coroutines simultaneously believe a model has
capacity. Workers are started lazily on first call — zero cost when the pool is unused.

**Drawbacks:**
Queue depth of 50 and worker count of 3 are fixed constants. A sustained burst beyond
50 concurrent callers will reject requests rather than queue them. Worker tasks are
daemon-style — an unhandled exception in a worker requires restart.

**How implemented:**
`GroqModelPool.__init__()` creates `self._queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=50)` and
`self._workers: list[asyncio.Task] = []`. `_ensure_workers_started()` lazily spawns
`_NUM_WORKERS = 3` worker coroutines as asyncio tasks on first call.
`_enqueue()` calls `queue.put_nowait()` (raises `QueueFull` on overflow) then
`await future`. Each `_worker(worker_id)` loop calls `await queue.get()`, dispatches
via `_dispatch()`, and resolves `item.future` with the result or exception.

**Where:** `llm/providers/groq_model_pool.py` — `_enqueue()`, `_worker()`, `_ensure_workers_started()`

---

### OPT-56 · Five-Model Dynamic Pool Routing with 4-Dimension Availability

**Category:** Reliability, Cost, Scalability

**What it does:**
`ModelRouter` selects the best available Groq model for every call using five sequential
availability checks across four rate limit dimensions. Two pools are defined:

- **FAST** (max_tokens ≤ 512): `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `qwen/qwen3-32b`
- **STRONG** (max_tokens > 512 or None): `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct`,
  `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `qwen/qwen3-32b`, `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

`qwen/qwen3-32b` appears in both pools with a single shared budget. Pool role is
auto-detected from the `max_tokens` kwarg — zero changes required in RAG variant code.

Availability checks (in order):
1. **429 cooldown** — skip if model is in active cooldown.
2. **RPM headroom** — skip if server-reported `remaining_rpm < 2` (stale-safe: skipped when header not yet received).
3. **TPM headroom** — skip if server-reported `remaining_tpm < max(est_tokens, 500)`.
4. **Daily RPD ceiling** — skip if locally-tracked `used_rpd ≥ rpd - 5`.
5. **Daily TPD ceiling** — skip if locally-tracked `used_tpd + est_tokens ≥ tpd - 2000`.

When the primary pool is exhausted, the router cross-pool overflows to the secondary
pool before returning `None`. On 429, `_dispatch` calls `router.on_429(model_id,
retry_after)` immediately — cooldown is set from the `Retry-After` response header.
On 404 (model not found / unlisted), the model enters a 24-hour cooldown via
`on_429(model_id, retry_after=86_400)` so the pool never retries an unavailable model.

Rate limit state is updated from server-authoritative response headers
(`x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens`) via
`RateLimitTracker.update_from_headers()` after every successful call. The OpenAI
SDK's built-in retry is disabled (`max_retries=0`) so 429s reach `_dispatch`
immediately rather than being absorbed by an 11-second SDK sleep.

**Benefit:**
Near-zero downtime on Groq free tier: when one model's minute window is exhausted,
the next model in priority order is tried within the same request. Daily budgets are
tracked locally and prevent routing to a model that is about to hit its 1,000 RPD
ceiling. The `qwen3-32b` shared-budget design means FAST pool overflow doesn't double-
count its daily quota. Header-authoritative minute-window state prevents the optimistic
routing mistakes that cause burst 429s under concurrency.

**Drawbacks:**
Local daily counters reset on process restart — in-flight usage from a prior run is
invisible. Header values lag by one round trip — the first call to a model after its
minute window resets may use stale `remaining_rpm = 0` and incorrectly skip it
(mitigated by the `is_minute_window_fresh()` staleness check). Priority order is
hardcoded; A/B testing different routing strategies requires a code change.

**How implemented:**
`ModelRouter.route(role, est_tokens)` iterates the primary pool via
`_pick_from_pool()` → `_is_model_available()`. `RateLimitTracker` (singleton) holds
one `ModelRateLimitState` per model with asyncio-locked reads/writes.
`update_from_headers(model_id, headers)` parses the four Groq rate limit headers.
`increment_daily(model_id, tokens)` updates `used_rpd` / `used_tpd`.
`on_429(model_id, cooldown_seconds)` sets `in_cooldown=True` and `cooldown_until`.

**Where:**
`llm/providers/model_router.py` — `ModelRouter`;
`llm/rate_limiter/rate_limit_tracker.py` — `RateLimitTracker`, `ModelRateLimitState`;
`llm/rate_limiter/model_limits.py` — `MODEL_RATE_LIMITS`;
`llm/providers/groq_model_pool.py` — `_dispatch()`

---

## 13. Agents

---

### OPT-45 · Heuristic Complexity Detection (No LLM Cost)

**Category:** Performance, Cost

**What it does:**
`ComplexityDetector.should_decompose()` uses weighted heuristic scoring — comparison
signal (+3), conjunction/multi-question (+2 each), multi-entity (+2), long query (+1)
— to decide if agent decomposition is needed. Threshold: score >= 3. No LLM call
required.

**Benefit:**
Routes ~80% of simple queries directly to `SimpleRAG` with zero overhead. Agent
decomposition (which involves 3–5 extra LLM calls) is triggered only for genuinely
complex queries.

**Drawbacks:**
Heuristic, not ML-based — edge cases are misclassified. Fixed threshold (3) may cause
under-decomposition of subtle multi-hop queries. Cannot detect complexity from
semantic content alone.

**How implemented:**
`should_decompose()` computes a weighted score from regex pattern matches on the query.
Returns `True` if `score >= self.threshold`.

**Where:** `agents/planner/complexity_detector.py`

---

### OPT-46 · Parallel Sub-Query Execution with Semaphore

**Category:** Performance, Scalability

**What it does:**
`ParallelRetriever` executes all independent sub-queries concurrently using
`asyncio.gather()`, with an `asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent=4)` to prevent LLM
provider rate-limit storms. Falls back to sequential if `parallel_safe=False`.

**Benefit:**
3–4× speedup for multi-part queries. A 4-sub-query decomposition runs in ~1× retrieval
time instead of 4×. The semaphore prevents a concurrent burst from triggering
provider 429s.

**Drawbacks:**
Concurrent requests compete for rate limiter tokens. `max_concurrent=4` is a
heuristic that works for most providers but may need tuning per deployment. Errors in
one sub-query do not abort others (isolation by design).

**How implemented:**
`asyncio.gather(*[self._retrieve_with_semaphore(q) for q in sub_queries])` in
`ParallelRetriever.retrieve_all()`. Each coroutine acquires the semaphore before
calling `BaseRAG.query()`.

**Where:** `agents/retriever/parallel_retriever.py`

---

### OPT-47 · Two-Stage Result Verification (Heuristic + Optional LLM)

**Category:** Quality, Cost

**What it does:**
`ResultVerifier.verify()` always runs cheap heuristic checks (answer length,
confidence threshold, non-answer phrases). Optionally, when `use_llm=True`, runs an
additional LLM-based quality check per result. Heuristic failures short-circuit before
the LLM check.

**Benefit:**
Catches obvious failures (empty answers, low confidence, "I don't know" responses) for
free. LLM verification is available for high-stakes use cases without adding cost to
the common path.

**Drawbacks:**
Heuristics miss nuanced failures (plausible-sounding wrong answers). LLM verification
adds one API call per sub-query result when enabled.

**How implemented:**
`_heuristic_check()` runs first. Only on pass does `_llm_check()` run when
`use_llm=True`. Results marked with `verified=True/False`.

**Where:** `agents/verifier/result_verifier.py`

---

## 14. Chunking & Document Processing

---

### OPT-48 · Structure-Aware Chunk Routing

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
`Chunker.split_documents()` routes each page to a structure-specific splitter based
on `metadata["structure_type"]`: tables use row-group splitting, code uses function-
boundary splitting, lists use item-group splitting, standard text uses recursive
character splitting.

**Benefit:**
Prevents semantic fragmentation — code functions stay together, table rows are not
split mid-row, list items are not orphaned. Estimated 15–25% better retrieval
precision for structured documents.

**Drawbacks:**
Structure detection adds preprocessing overhead. Incorrect structure labelling (a
false-positive "code" on formatted text) causes misrouted splitting that may produce
worse results than the default splitter.

**How implemented:**
`_get_splitter_for_type(structure_type)` returns the appropriate `TextSplitter`.
Called per page in `split_documents()`.

**Where:** `chunking/chunker.py` — `split_documents()`, `_get_splitter_for_type()`

---

### OPT-49 · Zero-Overlap Re-splitting for Oversized Chunks

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
After primary splitting, chunks exceeding `max_chunk_size` are re-split using a
zero-overlap splitter. Zero overlap prevents the same text from appearing in two
adjacent chunks, which would cause the LLM to process duplicate content.

**Benefit:**
Avoids token waste and potential confusion from duplicate context. Ensures all chunks
are within the embedding model's maximum input length.

**Drawbacks:**
Zero overlap means no context bridging between re-split fragments. A concept split
across fragment boundaries loses coherence without the overlapping window that the
primary splitter provides.

**How implemented:**
`_filter_chunks()` detects `len(chunk.page_content) > max_chunk_size`, runs
`_resplitter.split_text(chunk.page_content)` with `chunk_overlap=0`.

**Where:** `chunking/chunker.py` — `_filter_chunks()`

---

### OPT-50 · Document Structure Preservation in Metadata

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
`StructurePreserver` annotates each `Document` with `metadata["structure_type"]`
(heading, table, code, list, standard) and `metadata["section_heading"]` (propagated
from the most recent heading on prior pages) using regex pattern detection.

**Benefit:**
Enables structure-aware chunking downstream (OPT-48). Section heading propagation
means chunks from multi-page sections retain context about which section they belong
to, improving MMR diversity scoring and retrieval precision.

**Drawbacks:**
Regex-based detection — false positives on title-case body text or heavily formatted
documents. Heading propagation may assign the wrong section to pages in documents
with non-standard heading styles.

**How implemented:**
`StructurePreserver.preserve()` iterates `List[Document]`, calls `_tag_document()`
per page, propagates `_current_heading` across pages.

**Where:** `chunking/structure_preserver.py`

---

### OPT-51 · Boilerplate Stripping Before Chunking

**Category:** Quality

**What it does:**
`DocumentCleaner` strips page numbers, URLs, copyright notices, email addresses, and
common boilerplate phrases from document text using compiled regex patterns before
the content reaches the chunking pipeline.

**Benefit:**
Reduces noise in embedding vectors — boilerplate contributes nothing to semantic
similarity but consumes tokens and may distort nearest-neighbour search results.
Cleaner chunks produce more accurate retrieval.

**Drawbacks:**
Patterns are hardcoded. Legitimate URLs in technical content (API endpoints,
references) and email addresses in contact sections are stripped along with
boilerplate.

**How implemented:**
`DocumentCleaner._clean_documents()` applies `re.sub(pattern, "", text)` for each
pattern in `_BOILERPLATE_PATTERNS`.

**Where:** `chunking/document_cleaner.py` — `_clean_documents()`

---

### OPT-52 · Multi-Format Document Loading with Fallback

**Category:** Reliability, Quality

**What it does:**
`DocumentCleaner.load_and_clean()` selects the appropriate loader by file extension.
For PDFs: defaults to `PyMuPDFLoader`; if `prefer_pdfplumber=True`, tries
`PDFPlumberLoader` (better table extraction). Falls back to `PyMuPDFLoader` on any
PDFPlumber error.

**Benefit:**
Single entry point for all document types. `PDFPlumberLoader` recovers table structure
that `PyMuPDFLoader` loses in complex PDFs. Fallback ensures no document fails to
load.

**Drawbacks:**
`PDFPlumberLoader` is 2–3× slower than `PyMuPDF`. No auto-detection of which loader
is better for a given PDF — user must know to enable `prefer_pdfplumber` for
table-heavy documents.

**How implemented:**
`_load_pdf()` checks `self.prefer_pdfplumber`, tries `PDFPlumberLoader`, catches
`Exception` and falls back to `PyMuPDFLoader`.

**Where:** `chunking/document_cleaner.py` — `_load_pdf()`

---

### OPT-57 · Short-Page Merging to Prevent Silent Content Loss

**Category:** Quality, Reliability

**What it does:**
Replaces the naive "drop short pages" filter in `DocumentCleaner._clean_documents()`
with a two-phase strategy that guarantees zero silent content loss:

**Phase 1 — noise rejection:** `_clean_text()` strips boilerplate (standalone page
numbers, URLs, copyright lines) *before* the length check. Pages that become empty
after stripping are pure noise and are dropped.

**Phase 2 — short-page merging:** Pages that survive stripping but are below
`min_chars_per_page` are buffered (stored as `(text, metadata)` tuples) and stitched
into the next qualifying page by prepending the buffer. The merged page retains the
qualifying page's metadata (source, page number) — the natural navigation anchor.

Three flush rules handle every edge case:
- **Mid-document:** buffer prepended to next qualifying page; buffer cleared.
- **Trailing:** buffer appended to the last kept page via a new `Document` object
  (no in-place mutation).
- **Entire document short:** each buffered page kept individually with its original
  metadata rather than collapsed or dropped.

**Benefit:**
Critical single-sentence content — a story climax, an epilogue fragment, a chapter
conclusion — is preserved and retrievable rather than silently discarded. Chapter and
section headers (`"Chapter 5"`, `"BOOK FIVE: 1806–1807"`) that hit the short-page
path are merged into the following page, enriching that chunk's retrieval signal with
section context. Prevents the failure mode where "what happened at the end?" returns
no answer because the final page was 14 characters and was dropped.

**Drawbacks:**
A merged chunk is slightly larger than its qualifying page alone — downstream chunk
splitting will handle the overflow, but the short content may appear in a different
chunk boundary than its original page position. The qualifying page's metadata (not
the short page's) is used for the merged document, so the short page's original page
number is not directly surfaced in the chunk metadata.

**How implemented:**
`_clean_documents()` maintains `short_buffer: List[tuple]` of `(cleaned_text,
original_metadata)` pairs. On each page: empty → drop; short → `short_buffer.append`;
qualifying → flush buffer with `"\n\n".join(text for text, _ in short_buffer)` +
prepend + `short_buffer = []`. Post-loop trailing flush creates a new `Document` to
avoid mutating the stored instance. All-short-pages fallback uses a list comprehension
over the buffer tuples to preserve per-page metadata.

**Where:** `chunking/document_cleaner.py` — `_clean_documents()`

### OPT-53 · Centralised Pydantic Settings with Validation

**Category:** Reliability, Maintainability

**What it does:**
All system configuration is defined in a single `Settings(BaseSettings)` class with
type annotations and `@field_validator` decorators. Values are read from `.env` and
environment variables. Invalid values raise `ValidationError` at startup, not
mid-query.

**Benefit:**
Configuration errors are caught at startup before any request is served. All tunable
knobs (batch sizes, thresholds, model names, URLs) are changeable via `.env` without
code changes. Type annotations provide IDE support and catch type errors.

**Drawbacks:**
A large settings file becomes a maintenance burden. Pydantic validation errors on
complex nested validators can be cryptic. All modules depend on the `settings`
singleton — hard to isolate in unit tests without env var mocking.

**How implemented:**
`class Settings(BaseSettings): ...` with `@field_validator(...)` decorators.
Singleton `settings = Settings()` at module level, imported by every dependent module.

**Where:** `config/settings.py`

### OPT-54 · RAGFactory Registry-Based Variant Selection

**Category:** Scalability, Maintainability

**What it does:**
`RAGFactory` uses two class-level registry dicts — `_variant_registry`
(name → class) and `_retriever_registry` (mode → class) — to map string
configuration values to concrete implementations. Adding a new variant or retriever
requires one registry line.

**Benefit:**
Eliminates if/elif dispatch chains. New variants (e.g., a future `GraphRAG`) are
registered without modifying factory logic. Supports runtime registration via the
public `register_variant()` API for plugins or tests.

**Drawbacks:**
Runtime registration can cause import-order bugs. Registry is class-level shared
state — concurrent registration in parallel tests can cause interference.

**How implemented:**
`_variant_registry = {"simple": SimpleRAG, "corrective": CorrectiveRAG, "chain": ChainRAG}`.
`create()` validates via `_validate_variant()` then instantiates the resolved class.

**Where:** `rag/rag_factory.py`
